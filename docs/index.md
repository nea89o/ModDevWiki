# Welcome to nea89s Modding Wiki

This wiki is aimed at mod developers for Minecraft 1.8.9 and those that want to be. More specifically, this wiki is here for client mods for Hypixels [SkyBlock](https://wiki.hypixel.net/Main_Page).

First a word of warning: Modding isn't always for the faint of heart. Mojang doesn't really intend for people to mod their game, so there isn't exactly a lot of documentation laying around. What little documentation you will find is probably for newer versions and most mod dev forums either can't or don't want to help you with an [8 year old minecraft version](https://howoldisminecraft189.today/). But while starting with a mod as your first programming project isn't great and it helps to know your ways around Java as well, if you are passionate then I believe you can do it!

Despite all that, there is still a community around modding SkyBlock. You don't have to go into this alone, you can always join up with an existing modding team, which also helps beating the ratting allegations. Check out [existing mods and their communities][mod-list]! Almost everything is more fun with other people, and learning from other people will never be replaced by a cold, heartless wiki such as this one.

If you get all that and you are still in, then let's [start with the IDE set up](ide-setup.md).
