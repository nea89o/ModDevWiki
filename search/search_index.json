More specifically, this wiki is here for client mods for Hypixels SkyBlock.</p> <p>First a word of warning: Modding isn't always for the faint of heart. Mojang doesn't really intend for people to mod their game, so there isn't exactly a lot of documentation laying around. What little documentation you will find is probably for newer versions and most mod dev forums either can't or don't want to help you with an 8 year old minecraft version. But while starting with a mod as your first programming project isn't great and it helps to know your ways around Java as well, if you are passionate then I believe you can do it!</p> <p>Despite all that, there is still a community around modding SkyBlock. You don't have to go into this alone, you can always join up with an existing modding team, which also helps beating the ratting allegations. Check out existing mods and their communities! Almost everything is more fun with other people, and learning from other people will never be replaced by a cold, heartless wiki such as this one.</p> <p>If you get all that and you are still in, then let's start with the IDE set up.</p>"},{"location":"ide-setup/","title":"Setting up","text":"<p>This is a slightly rewritten version of SBMW's Getting started article.

In theory it is also possible to code in VSCode, Vim or Eclipse, but doing so is difficult to set up and not recommended.

You can usually find both linked on their page on the SkyBlock Mod Wiki. You can typically ask around in the Discord for help, which will help you to get up to speed with whether they will accept a feature you are planning to contribute. Once all of that is cleared, you can create a Fork on GitHub. You will then do everything with the forked repository as you would do with your own repository, and once you are done create a pull request in the original repository you are planning to contribute to.</p>"},{"location":"ide-setup/#creating-a-new-project","title":"Creating a new Project","text":"<p>Go to Forge1.8.9Template.
